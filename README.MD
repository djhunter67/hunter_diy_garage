# Hunter DIY Garage

The purpose of this project is to provide information regarding the Hunter DIY Garage.

### Synopsis

-   The do-it-yourself (DIY) garage will have several different bays of automotive repair paraphernalia. The location will feature, but not be limited to heavy duty vehicle lifts, small vehicle lifts, medium vehicle lifts, center lifts, and four post lifts.

-   The DIY garage will feature a basic tool-kit at every bay. There will be specialty, powered, and unique tooling available for checkout as needed. There will be a machining station permanently manned by an employee that bares a skillset that includes welding, operating a lathe, and operating a mill.

### Problem

-   In my brief experience as an auto technician I have witnessed my peers decieve and overcharge trusting customers. I have seen customers pay for basic vehicle maintenance where the technician does not bother to fulfill the expectation of payment.
